# Apico

> **Apico** is not a framework.  It is a tool that help you to speed up the development of 
> projects build on **Express JS**


**Apico** will build for you a project with specific folder structure. Every folder in this project will be used in defferent parts in this project.
So, for instance, if you want to add a new route that will run a HTML page you just need to run a CLI provided by **Apico**. This will create a folder under the `frontend/dist/`  folder.

# Quick start

# The project structure
### *frontend/dist/apps/* : 
	This will have all your frontend app files.
		

> You should probably wondered waht is an app. Every route that will actualy render a HTML file is calling app.
> You don't need to build separate route for separate HTML page. **Apico**  usese folder structure for rendring HTML/CSS/JS file for you. So, as you noticed, every app will have at least thre files: HTML, CSS and JS.

### *frontend/shared/*:

	layouts nad partials that will be used with EJS.
